# Assignment 02


## Assignment Description
Develop a small project using a RESTful API of your own choice. 
You may combine two or more APIs if you need to.
*The only minimum requirement is to demonstrate usage at least 5 different API requests*

[See Starter Code Here](https://github.com/Web-Advanced-Spring-2017/wiki/tree/master/starter-code)

Some of the APIs to look into:
* [The Big List of Public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)
* [Another 300 public APIs](https://any-api.com/)

You may use this as your golden source to dive deeper into publically available services that you can utilize for your upcoming projects.

## Submission Details
All the submission must be done through github to our [class organization](https://github.com/Web-Advanced-Spring-2017). The assignment will be accomodated and distributed using [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/). GitHub classroom will automatically create a repository in our organization for each student and will grant administrative rights of that repository to that student.    
All students **MUST** visit this url: [Confirmation Link](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/36e19048eb7663ae1786db6d71333cef). There you will be asked to accept and confirm the reception of the Assignment and consequently a repository will be automatically created for you under our organization. The name of your repository will follow the following pattern: `assignment-02-${your GitHub username}`.

In your own new assignment respository `https://github.com/Web-Advanced-Spring-2017/assignment-02-${your username}`, go on and delete README.md and replace it with the readme of your choice.
