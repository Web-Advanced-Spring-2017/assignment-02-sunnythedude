## Assignment Description
* I used the Twitter, Instagram & Google Maps API'S. 
* I used the Google Maps API to display some New School locations I frequent on a map along with a pop up label that appears when you click on the marker.
* I used the twitter API to do two things. Firstly to send out a tweet (one of a possible six within an array) every 20 seconds on my Twitter Feed and secondly to send out a bot generated reply everytime someone follows me on twitter.
* I used the Instagram API to grab the images from my instagram and post them onto an HTML page.
